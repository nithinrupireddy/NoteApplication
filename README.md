# NoteApplication

This is a simple note-taking application built with SQLite and Room Persistence Library. 

The Room Persistence library makes it much easier to build a cache, to know more about it i built a small note application by taking course on codingwithmitch.

It is worth learning about Room, because it reduces a lot of boiler-plate code.

Other Few things which i implemented are "How to handle Screen Orientations" , "Custom ToolBar", "RecyclerView", "Drawing Parallel lines" in EditText
